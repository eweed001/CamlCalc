Set Functions:
- Union
- Intersect
- Difference 
- Is Equal ("is_equal")
- Is Disjoint ("is_disjoint")
- Is Subset ("is_subset")

These functions all take in 2 sets as arguments.
ex.
let s = [1 2 3 4]
let stwo = [ 3 4 5 6]
union s stwo 

- Append
- Remove ("remove_val")
- Get ("get_elem")

These sets all take in a set and the value to be either added, removed, or
position to get as the argument. 
Note: these functions do not mutate the set you pass in, just print out the 
result of the function applied to that set. If you want to save the result,
bind the application to a variable
ex. 
let s = [1 2 3]
let s' = append s 4

- Length

This function takes in one argument; the set you want to get the length of

The result of all these functions can be bound to variable name using a let 
definition
