Code File Reading Help:

CAMLCALC supports the ability to run on a pre-written text file. In order for 
it to function correctly you need to save the file (ending in ".txt") in the 
same directory this project is in.

Inside the .txt file should be lines of code according to the rules of the 
CAMLCALC language, with each statement on a new line.
 
To run this functionality, just type the name of the file, including .txt, 
within the calculator and the contents of the file along with the values each
line evaluated to will be printed. If any variable name bindings were created 
inside the file, they will be accessible after the file has been run.
