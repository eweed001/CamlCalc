Matrix Functions:

- Creation

Matrices can be defined in two ways: 
1. Defining the rows first then the matrix of those rows 

let one = [1 2]
let two = [3 4]
let m = matrix one two

2. Defining the matrix as a list of rows

let m = matrix [1 2] [3 4]

These both represent the same matrix.
Both ways require the "matrix" keyword

- Addition ("madd")
- Subtraction ("msub")
- Multiplication ("mdot")

These functions all take in 2 matrices as the arguments. For addition and 
subtraction, the matrices must be of the same size. For multiplication the 
matrices must follow the dimensions M x N, N x R where M could equal R, but 
doesn't have to

- Row Echelon Form Reduction ("echelon")
- Reduced Row Echelon Form Reduction ("rref")
- Determinant ("determinant")

These functions both take in one matrix as an argument and return the echelon 
form, the reduced row echelon form or the determinant of that matrix accordingly

- Eigenvectors ("eigenvectors")
This function takes in two arguments, the matrix and the row of eigenvalues.
In order to calculate eigenvectors, define a matrix as explained
above and define the known set of eigenvectors as a row. Then pass them in as 
the arguments to this function

ex. 
let a = matrix [0 1] [-2 -3] 
let eig = [-1 -2]
eigenvectors a eig

or

let a = matrix [0 1] [-2 -3] in let eig = [-1 -2] in eigenvectors a eig
