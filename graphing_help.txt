Graphing Help:

In order to graph a function, you need to define it according to the function 
definition rule: (let <function name> = fun ( <argument list> ) -> <function body>).
ex.
let f = fun (x) -> x*x

Then in order to graph the function, type in 
"graph <function name> <lower bound> <upper bound>"
ex. 
graph f -10 10


Derivatives, Integrals:

In order to graph a derivative, you first have to define the function of which
a derivative is to be taken of. For example:

let parabola = fun (x) -> x*x
let line = fun (x) -> deriv parabola x 0.01

Now [line] is a graphable function that represents the derivative of [parabola].
To graph this function, simply graph it as you would do with any other:

graph line -10 10


In order to graph an integral, you first have to define the function of which
an integral is to be taken of. For example:

let line = fun (x) -> x
let parabola = fun (x) -> integ line 0 x

Now [parabola] is a graphable function that represents the integral of [line]
from 0 to some x. To graph this function, simply graph it as you would do with
any other:

graph parabola -10 10

This method of wrapping the derivatives/integrals of functions as functions
themselves works for second order derivatives and integrals as well, and is
graphable, albeit slower due to complexity. 

In order to increase speed, one may be able to lower the precision of
derivation or lessen the distance between the lower and upper bound of graphing



Note:
When graphing trigonometric functions, be aware that the bounds are in degrees!
