Fibonacci Functions:
- Nth fibonacci number ("nth")
- List of first n fibonacci numbers ("fib")

These functions both take one argument, being the number fibonacci number you 
want of the number of elements (starting with the first) you want, respectively

- List of first b elements of the n-step fibonacci sequence ("nfib")

This function takes two arguments, the first being the base for the fibonacci 
sequence and the second being the number of elements you want. 

The result of all these functions can be bound to variable name using a let 
definition
