Monty Hall Game Explaination:
The Monty Hall Game is a probability puzzle loosely based on the game show 
Let's Make a Deal and named after Monty Hall, the game show's long time host.
The game is based on three assumptions:
1. The host must always open a door that was not chosen by the user
2. The host must always open a door to reveal a goat 
3. The host must always offer the option to switch to the remaining door 

When the user chooses a door, say A, and the host opens a door, say B 
by choosing not to switch doors the users probability of winning remains at
1/3.
However if the user were to switch doors, they increase their probability 
of winning from 1/3 to 2/3. This is due to the fact that the host knows where
the car is and will only open a door with a goat behind it. 
In the case where the user chooses A, we can look at doors B and C as having
a probability of 2/3 of being the winning door. When the host opens door B,
the probability that door C is the winning door rises from 1/3 to 2/3 
(in a way absorbing the probability from door B which we know had a goat)
Thus the probability of winning when the user switches doors rises to 
2/3.
The main idea to consider is that the hosts choice as to which door they will 
open is not independent of the users first choice and the host knows where 
the car is.
